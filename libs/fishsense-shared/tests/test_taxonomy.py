"""Unit tests for the `content_of_image` taxonomy vocabulary.

`SpeciesLabel.content_of_image` is a ", "-joined Label Studio taxonomy path,
and four consumers read it: the stage-14 measure activity (Python), the
stage-14 cohort selector (SQLAlchemy), the `dive_pipeline_status` view (raw
SQL), and the stage-9 slate cohort. They used to spell the markers
independently, and the docstrings describing them had drifted so far that the
worked example in two files said `"Fish Model, …"` and
`"Calibration Targets, Ruler"` were skipped while the code six lines below
matched both as measurable.

`MEASURABILITY_CORPUS` is the shared fixture: every branch that actually
occurs, plus the boundary cases. `test_dive_pipeline_status_view.py` runs the
*SQL* predicate over the same corpus and asserts it agrees with
`is_measurable` here, so the two representations can't drift silently again.
