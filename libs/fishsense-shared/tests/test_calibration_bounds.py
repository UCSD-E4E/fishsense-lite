"""Unit tests for the shared laser-baseline bounds.

The baseline is the offset between camera and laser on one rig — hardware, not
a property of a dive. Over all 35 stored calibrations its interquartile range
is 9.99-10.45 cm, half a centimetre across both producers, every camera and two
years. Eight fits sit outside 9.7-14.5 cm and back 663 of 3,104 measurements at
-75% to +45% error, and two more (8.90, 9.51 cm) hide a -14 to -18 % close-range
error behind a flat-looking median.

Two services read these numbers: the data-worker refuses to persist a fit
outside them, and the api stops an already-stored one outside them from
counting as a calibration at all. Both behaviours are tested in their own
packages; what is pinned here is the arithmetic they share.
