"""What a physically plausible laser baseline is, spelled once.

The baseline is `norm(laser_position[:2])` — the offset between the camera
centre and the laser on one rig. It is hardware, not a property of a dive, and
measurement says so loudly: over all 35 stored calibrations its interquartile
range is **9.99-10.45 cm**, half a centimetre across both producers, every
camera and two years.

It lives in `fishsense_shared` for the same reason `taxonomy` and
`task_queues` do — two services need the identical number and neither owns it:

* the **data-worker** refuses to persist a fit outside these bounds
  (`calibration_consistency.check_baseline_plausible`);
* the **api** excludes an already-stored calibration outside them from
  counting as a calibration at all, so its dive re-enters the calibration
  cohorts instead of being measured against a fit we know is wrong.

A copy in each would be the drift this repo keeps rediscovering, and here the
two halves disagreeing is especially quiet: the api would hand a dive back for
recalibration that the data-worker then persists unchanged, hourly, forever.

**Why bounding the answer is the only check that works.** Nothing upstream
distinguishes a good fit from a bad one. Measured 2026-09-11 by rendering the
detected lattices: 60 of 61 frames found the full 14x10 board on good and bad
dives alike. Observation count does not separate them (one dive fits 2.60 cm
from 19 clean observations, three fit correctly from 2), nor does depth spread,
nor detection rate. And `check_fit_self_consistency` is structurally blind to
the baseline: it compares the fitted ray's *projection* to its 2-D dots, and
sliding the laser's offset leaves that projection identical.

#: Bounds on the baseline, in metres.

#: **Placed midway between the populations, not hard against the healthy one.**
#: The floor moved from 7.8 to 9.7 cm on 2026-09-12. Two fits inside the old
#: bound, 8.90 cm (dive 502, borrowed by 503/504) and 9.51 cm (dive 498), had
#: been called healthy on the strength of a ~-1 % median length error. The
#: range trend of a rigid target showed why the median lied: -14 to -18 % at
#: 0.8 m rising to ~0 at 4 m -- the short baseline's flat scale error and a
#: compensating angle error cancel exactly where the median and p90 sit. Sound
#: calibrations (10.3-10.5 cm) are flat across range to within 1 %. So the
#: nearest bad fit below is now 9.51 and the smallest sound one 9.87 (dive 94);
#: 9.7 sits between them. Above, healthy 12.95 and bad 16.01 are unchanged.
#:
#: **Widen only against re-measured data**, and measure with the range trend
#: (`range_trend.py` in the data-worker), not the median: a wrong baseline is
#: the one error the rest of the pipeline provably cannot see. It scales every
#: depth, hence every length, while reprojection residual and self-consistency
#: stay clean -- and, as above, a compensating angle error can hide it from a
#: known-length median too.
