/**
 * Real Label Studio payloads, captured from a live instance (1.13.1) rather
 * than hand-written.
 *
 * Every other test in this suite mocks `fetch`, which means the *shape* of
 * Label Studio's response is something we assert about ourselves. That blind
 * spot is what shipped the empty queue: `/api/tasks/?project=N` omits
 * `predictions` entirely, so judging the list row refused every task in every
 * project with "no prediction (0 present)" — and four deploys went out before
 * anyone looked at an actual response body.
 *
 * These fixtures are the one thing in the suite that cannot drift from
 * reality, because they were reality. Re-capture them if Label Studio is
 * upgraded; do not edit them by hand.
