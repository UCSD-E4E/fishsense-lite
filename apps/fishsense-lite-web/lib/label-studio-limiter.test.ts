/**
 * Hosted Label Studio rate-limits per account, so the budget is shared by
 * every request this app makes — the landing page's project fan-out, the
 * triage queue's task scan, the image proxy, the token refresh, and the
 * accept POST all draw on one pool.
 *
 * Nothing enforced that. `getProjects` fanned out over every project id with
 * `Promise.allSettled`, which with one LS project per dive is a burst of
 * dozens of simultaneous requests; each 429 was then retried independently,
 * so a rate-limited load turned into several times as many requests as the
 * load that caused it. Observed in prod 2026-09-07: 20+ consecutive
 * `GET /api/projects/{id}` 429s in the web container log.
