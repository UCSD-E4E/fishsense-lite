/**
 * One shared throttle in front of every Label Studio request.
 *
 * Hosted Label Studio rate-limits per account, so the budget belongs to the
 * app, not to any one caller. The landing page's project fan-out, the triage
 * queue's task scan, the image proxy, the token refresh and the accept POST
 * all spend from the same pool — and until this existed, none of them knew
 * the others were spending.
 *
 * Two faults followed from that, and the second is the one that made a busy
 * moment self-sustaining:
 *
 *  * `getProjects` fetched every project id at once with `Promise.allSettled`.
 *    There is one LS project per dive, so that is a burst of dozens of
 *    simultaneous requests every time the cache is cold. Prod 2026-09-07: 20+
 *    consecutive `GET /api/projects/{id}` 429s in the web container log.
 *  * Each 429 was then retried by its own caller, independently. A burst of 30
 *    requests answered a single rate-limit window with 30 more, so the retry
 *    traffic was several times the traffic that earned the limit.
 *
 * So this bounds concurrency AND shares what it learns: a 429 seen by one
 * request holds back every request that has not been sent yet. Retrying is
 * centralised here too, because four call sites with four private backoff
 * loops is exactly how the amplification got in.
