 * or at a cloud metadata endpoint, and this server fetches it from inside the
 * private network and streams the body back.
 *
 * Label Studio is trusted, but task data is writable by anyone who can create
 * a task, so "it came from Label Studio" is not the same as "it is safe to
 * fetch". The previous implementation was accidentally safe here because it
 * only ever hit a fixed path on a fixed host; resolving properly removed that
 * accident and had to replace it deliberately.
 *
