/**
 * Head/tail triage, and the one rule that is not shared with laser.
 *
 * `sync_headtail_labels_for_label_studio_project_activity` needs BOTH points:
 * it filters `from_name == "kp-1"`, picks the two regions out by their
 * `keypointlabels[0]` (`Snout` and `Fork`), and only writes x/y when it found
 * both. But `completed = task.is_labeled` flips true regardless — and
 * `_select_unlabeled_images` then excludes that image for good.
 *
 * So accepting a half prediction is not "a slightly worse label", it is the
 * same permanent-exclusion trap that is the reason Skip writes nothing. One
 * point must be refused outright rather than offered with a warning.
 *
 * The populate emits either zero regions or exactly two, so this should not
 * occur today. That is a reason to encode the rule here, not a reason to rely
 * on the far side of an HTTP boundary continuing to hold it.
