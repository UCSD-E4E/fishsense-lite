/**
 * Streams a task's frame through this server.
 *
 * Two reasons this is a proxy rather than a redirect. Label Studio's
 * `resolve` endpoint is on its API server and is **authenticated**, and the
 * bearer it wants expires in about five minutes — shorter than a labeling
 * session, so a URL handed to the browser would go stale mid-queue. Fetching
 * server-side means the client never holds a Label Studio credential at all.
 *
 * It takes only a task id, never a `fileuri`. Accepting a caller-supplied URI
 * would make this an open proxy that fetches anything the server can reach;
 * resolving the URI from the task itself keeps the reachable set to frames
 * that already belong to a project.
