"""Unit tests for the api-worker's NasClient.

Pins the 2026-05-07 stage 2 incident: DSM returned 200 OK with a
JSON-error body after the staging activity's idle session timed out
(~30 min default DSM SID TTL). The previous synology-api 0.8.x
`get_file(mode='download')` implementation streamed the JSON-error
body to disk and returned a tuple instead of raising; the surrounding
wrapper only caught `FileStationError` exceptions, so the corruption
slipped through silently. Callers (`stage_raw_bytes_for_dive_activity`)
read the JSON bytes via `read_bytes()` and uploaded them to the
file-exchange as `.ORF` content — every subsequent stage-2
`preprocess_species_image` activity received those JSON bytes, failed
`rawpy.imread` with `LibRawIOError: Input/output error`, and Temporal
retried 60+ times before the workflow timed out.

The migration to `synology-filestation` (`Client`) eliminates the
underlying-library footgun: it raises typed exceptions on JSON errors
and writes downloads atomically. The test below pins the *behavioral
contract* on `NasClient.download_to` so any future implementation
swap (or accidental regression) re-trips the same alarm before
corrupt content can reach the file-exchange.
