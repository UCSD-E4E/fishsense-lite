"""Which `model_version` a per-dive Label Studio project is pointed at.

Attaching a prediction is not enough to show one: LS surfaces predictions to
annotators only for the version named in the *project's* `model_version`. A
labeler worked five frames of dive 94 by hand while 334 predictions sat
invisible, because both backfills attach via `predictions.create`, which does
not set that field, while `import_tasks` sets it for free.

The two rules below are each a bug that was written and then caught:

* the tier is chosen by **count**, not by "newest wins" -- switching a project
  showing 40 fallback predictions to a tier holding 2 blanks 38 tasks to
  reveal 2;
* only **per-dive** projects are touched -- `model_version` is project-global
  while these counts come from one dive, so on a shared project two dives at
  different tiers would overwrite each other on alternate runs.
