"""The species XML and `taxonomy.LABELED_FISH_MODELS` must not drift.

`LABELED_FISH_MODELS` is what the API grades against — it decides which models
need a `fishmodelreference` row. The species labeling XML is what a labeler can
actually pick. If the two disagree, the disagreement is **silent in both
directions**:

  * a model in the XML but not the list gets no reference row, and the accuracy
    view inner-joins it away — its measurements simply never appear (this is
    exactly what `Weasly Fish` did);
  * a model in the list but not the XML demands a reference row nobody can ever
    produce a measurement for.

The XML lives in the api-worker and the grading lives in the API, which is why
the shared list exists at all and why this parity test does.
