"""Unit tests for `list_dive_folder_activity` — the first step of ingest.

The behaviour under test is almost entirely about what ingest *refuses* to do.

**One request means one dive, and a dive is exactly one directory.** That is
not a simplification: spider walked the tree recursively but then assigned
`dive = image.parent.relative_to(data_root)` (`discovery.py:238`), so a nested
folder always became its own separate dive row, never extra frames on the
parent. Attaching a subdirectory's frames to the named dive would merge dives
that are distinct rows in prod today — silently, and with no way to tell
afterwards which frames came from where.

So subdirectories holding `.ORF`s are *reported* and not ingested. That is the
Olympus rollover case: the TG-6 wraps its frame counter at `PA199999` and
starts a child folder mid-dive, which reads as "more frames of this dive" to a
human and as "a second dive" to every convention in the database.
