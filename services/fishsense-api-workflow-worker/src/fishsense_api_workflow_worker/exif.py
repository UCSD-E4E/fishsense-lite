"""Minimal EXIF reader for Olympus `.ORF`, stdlib only.

ORF is a TIFF variant (magic `IIRO` rather than the standard 42), so IFD
walking is all that's needed. Deliberately not using a library:

  * **Pillow cannot open ORF.** `TiffImagePlugin` rejects the magic; the legacy
    spider got away with it on Pillow 11.3.0, but current Pillow raises
    `cannot identify image file`.
  * **rawpy** is a data-worker dependency, kept out of the api-worker image on
    purpose (it drags in opencv and libGL for a service whose job is NAS I/O).
  * **exiftool** is what spider shelled out to. It works, at the cost of a Perl
    runtime in the image and a subprocess per batch.

It also works on a **ranged read of the first megabyte**, which is what lets
the ingest dry-run inspect a dive for ~1 MB per file instead of ~15 MB.

Two details are load-bearing:

1. `taken_datetime` comes from tag **0x0132 (`DateTime`)**, not 0x9003
   (`DateTimeOriginal`). That is what spider read, so ~111k existing
   `Image.taken_datetime` values follow it. The two are usually equal, which
   is precisely why reading the wrong one would look fine and drift quietly.
2. Olympus MakerNote offsets are **relative to the start of the MakerNote
   block**, and the Equipment sub-IFD pointer has **type 13** — a non-standard
   IFD type. Miss either and the walk silently finds nothing, which is what
   made MakerNote parsing look infeasible on the first attempt.
