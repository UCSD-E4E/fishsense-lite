"""FileStation-backed NAS client for the api-worker.

Backed by the `synology-filestation` Rust client (PyO3 wheel from
`UCSD-E4E/synology-filestation`). Replaces the previous `synology-api`
PyPI package — see [CLAUDE.md] / commit log for the 2026-05-07 stage 2
incident that drove the swap. Two behavioral wins from the new client
the api-worker explicitly relies on:

  * **DSM JSON-error responses raise typed exceptions.** `synology-api`
    streamed JSON-error response bodies to disk and returned a tuple
    instead of raising, which let corrupt JSON propagate downstream as
    `.ORF` content. The new `Client` raises `SidNotFound` (DSM 119),
    `NoSuchFile`, etc. on the same response shapes.
  * **Atomic `download_to` writes.** `Client.download_to` writes to
    `<local>.part` and renames on success. A failed download leaves no
    partial file at the destination, so the staging activity can't
    accidentally read corrupt bytes back via `read_bytes`.

Operations:
  * `download_to(src_path, dest_dir)` — Phase 3a staging-in.
  * `upload(dest_dir, src_file_path)` — Phase 3b archive.
  * `exists(file_path)` — idempotency HEAD-equivalent for archive.

The wrapper class preserves its previous external shape so call sites
in `stage_raw_bytes_for_dive_activity`, `archive_processed_jpegs_to_nas_activity`,
and `cleanup_raw_bytes_for_dive_activity` are unchanged.
