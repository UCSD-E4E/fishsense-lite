"""Turn a stored species judgement into a Label Studio pre-annotation.

A batch of hand-labelled species judgements arrived as a spreadsheet — 3,000
FSL-01 frames spanning 2023-08 to 2024-06, keyed by image checksum. They are
loaded as **sentinel** `SpeciesLabel` rows (`label_studio_project_id IS NULL`),
which every preprocess cohort reads as "no label for this image", so the dives
they belong to stay in the normal labelling flow. This module renders such a
row as an LS prediction, so the labeler is shown the judgement pre-filled and
confirms it instead of retyping it.

Prod holds **no** sentinel rows today -- zero for species, laser and head/tail
alike, whatever the `dive_cohort_controller` docstrings' "~2000 of them" says
about an earlier state -- so an import of judgements creates the first ones and
nothing else exercises this path.

**It is the exact inverse of `_parse_results` in the species sync activity**,
and that parser is the definition of record for what a result shape means. The
round-trip is pinned in `test_species_preannotation.py`, for the same reason
the taxonomy SQL/Python parity test exists: a pre-annotation whose shape the
parser reads differently would write the wrong column the moment a labeler
accepted it, with nothing raising.

Three fields are deliberately **not** pre-annotated, and this is the important
part of the design:

* `grouping` — a judgement about the frame *before* this one. The spreadsheet
  has no column for it and it is not inferable from one frame.
* `exclude` / `top_three_photos_of_group` — selects which frames of an
  individual get measured, and stage 14 keys measurability on it. A fabricated
  default would silently decide what gets measured.
* the slate branch's type choice (`H-Slate`, `V-Slate 2`, …) — the spreadsheet
  records a bare `Slate`, which is the taxonomy's parent node, not a leaf.
  `Dive.dive_slate_id` is written only from that choice and a wrong slate
  yields a wrong *scale*, which is precisely what reprojection residual cannot
  see. So the 346 slate rows carry no usable `content_of_image` and are not
  loaded at all; they stay a human's job.
