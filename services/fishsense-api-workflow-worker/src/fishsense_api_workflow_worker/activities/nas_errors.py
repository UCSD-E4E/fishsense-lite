"""Shared classification of Synology FileStation errors into retryable and
permanent.

Extracted from `stage_raw_bytes_for_dive_activity` when ingest needed the same
judgement. The rule it encodes is worth stating once: **retry/backoff belongs to
the Temporal retry policy on the activity call, never to an inner loop.** An
inner loop underneath Temporal's outer retry is what produced the
200×-per-file download storm that tripped the NAS auto-block (krg-infra#501).

So these helpers only *classify*. A permanent error becomes a non-retryable
`ApplicationError` so Temporal stops rescheduling something doomed; everything
else propagates untouched so the bounded jittered policy backs off and tries
again.

The code is recovered by string-parsing `DSMError`'s message because the
`synology-filestation` client doesn't expose it structurally yet (feedback
filed upstream). Delete `dsm_error_code` when it does.
