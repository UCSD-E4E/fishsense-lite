"""The dive line is fish-dominated, so it must not judge slate dots at 3 sigma.

Measured on prod 2026-09-13, against each dive's own line fitted through its
live measurement-frame dots:

    dive 347   319 fish dots, median 1.25 px off, max 3.1
               slate dots: 0.34, 3.44-8.48 (eleven frames, visually confirmed
               genuine), then 45.57, 50.59, 83.99, 130.18 (four mislabels)
    dive 349   125 fish dots, median 0.94 px off, max 2.9
               slate dots: 2.87-5.98, all twelve genuine

The 3 sigma test with a 1 px MAD floor lands at 3.56 px (347) and 3.00 px
(349), so it superseded eleven of 347's thirteen genuine slate dots and ten
of 349's twelve -- leaving each dive one or two usable observations, which is
exactly how 347 came to be calibrated from a single frame and 349 from two
dots 26 cm apart in range.

Why genuine slate dots sit a few px off a line their own dive's fish frames
define to ~1 px: the slate burst is a few seconds long and the fish frames
are minutes away, so a small in-plane rotation of the laser inside its mount
moves the burst coherently; and the burst is a dozen dots against hundreds,
so it cannot pull the fit toward itself.

The asymmetry is what sets the tolerance. Superseding a genuine slate dot
removes the dive's only route to a calibration and cannot be undone by
relabelling (`get_laser_label_by_label_studio_id` filters superseded rows),
while a 10 px error in one calibration dot is diluted by the others and
caught downstream by the four calibration gates. A 45+ px dot is a different
population -- a specular reflection or another object -- and must still go.

So calibration frames are judged coarsely and in absolute pixels, with the
bound between the two measured populations.
