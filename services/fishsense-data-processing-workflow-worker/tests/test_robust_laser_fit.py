"""Trimming outliers before the laser line fit.

`calibrate_laser` is plain least squares with no outlier rejection, so a single
badly-placed observation drags the whole line. That is not hypothetical: prod
dive 77 shipped a calibration whose lengths reached +137% because labelers
clicked the laser's specular reflection on about half the frames, and dive 103
carries a 6.25 cm baseline from **17 otherwise clean observations** — the shape
that neither a higher `MIN_LASER_POINTS` nor the baseline bound explains.

The damage is amplified by what the fit is asked for. The reported origin is
where the line crosses z=0, typically a metre or more behind the observations,
so a small angular error from one bad point is levered into a large error in
the baseline — which is exactly the quantity nothing downstream can see.

These tests are built on synthetic geometry with a known answer, because there
is no ground-truth set of real calibrations to validate against. That is a real
limit: they pin that trimming recovers the clean line when the contamination is
the shape we have seen, not that it helps on every real dive.

    When a contiguous subset is displaced by a *constant* offset it forms a

    splits the difference between the two, so every observation carries a
    similar moderate residual and none of them looks like an outlier. No
    residual-based trim can separate them, however the threshold is tuned.

    That failure is already covered, by `check_fit_self_consistency`: two
    parallel dot lines make the fitted ray reproject at an angle to the dots it
    came from, which is exactly what that gate measures (dive 77 read 14 deg
    against a fleet baseline of <=1.6 deg).

    isolated bad dots, self-consistency handles systematic contamination. This
    test exists so nobody later "fixes" the trimmer to chase this case and
    starts discarding good observations in the process.
