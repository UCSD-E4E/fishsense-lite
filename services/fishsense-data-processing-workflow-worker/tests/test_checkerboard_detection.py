"""Unit tests for the checkerboard corner detector.

The detector's whole job is to produce the `(body_points, image_points)` that
`calibration_geometry.plane_from_correspondences` turns into a plane — the
same pair a `DiveSlate`'s template points and hand-clicked corners produce
today. Everything downstream is already shared and already tested.

What is pinned here is the part that can go wrong *silently*, because
`solvePnP` does not refuse a bad correspondence set — it returns success and a
confident, meaningless pose:

  * correspondences are index-aligned and built from the **detected** grid,
    never the nominal board;
  * a grid bigger than the declared board is refused (wrong target linked);
  * a degenerate near-collinear detection is refused;
  * a sub-grid recovers the *same plane* as the full board, which is what
    makes partial detections usable at all — and how much less sharply it
    does so once real corner noise is in play.
