"""Unit tests for `calibration_geometry` — the target-agnostic half of stage 13.

Stage 13 fits laser extrinsics from observations of a dot lying on a plane of
known geometry. The *plane* is all the calibration target ever contributes: once
you have a normal and a point on it, recovering the dot's 3-D position is
identical whether the target was a dive slate, a checkerboard, or anything else
planar.

These tests pin that seam, because a second producer (checkerboard laser
calibration, `docs/plans/checkerboard-laser-calibration.md`) is about to be
built on it and the alternative is a second transcription of the projection —
which is exactly the drift `laser_geometry` was extracted to prevent.

Conventions match `test_perform_laser_calibration_activity`: +Z is depth,
projection is a plain pinhole through `CAMERA_MATRIX`, and `solvePnP` is given
zero distortion because the pipeline only ever feeds it rectified imagery.
