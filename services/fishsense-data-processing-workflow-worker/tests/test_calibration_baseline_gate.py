"""The baseline plausibility gate — the one check that sees the failing axis.

`check_fit_self_consistency` compares the fitted ray's *projection* against the
2D dots it came from. Many different 3D rays project to the same image line —
the whole family lying in the plane through the camera centre and that line —
and sliding the laser's offset along that family moves where the ray crosses
z=0 while leaving the projection identical. So that gate constrains two of the
ray's four degrees of freedom and the baseline sits in the two it cannot see.
It is the epipolar blindness already documented for reprojection residual and
scale, in a second guise.

Measured 2026-09-11 over all 35 stored calibrations: the baseline is a rig
constant. Its interquartile range is 9.99–10.45 cm — half a centimetre across
both producers, every camera and two years — while 8 fits sit outside 8–13 cm,
at 2.35, 2.60, 4.81, 4.90, 6.25, 6.91, 16.01 and 22.22 cm. Those 8 back 12
dives and 663 of 3,104 measurements, and their length errors run -75% to +45%.

Two of the eight are **slate**-derived, which is why this gate lives beside
`check_fit_self_consistency` rather than in the checkerboard path: both
producers feed the same fit and both can miss the same way.
