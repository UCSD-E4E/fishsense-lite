"""Reading the laser's colour off its own pixels.

The laser LS config offers "Red Laser" and "Green Laser", and the pre-annotation
used to hardcode "Red Laser" on every frame. That is wrong for roughly a
quarter of prod: of the dives with completed laser labels, 143 are entirely
red and 88 entirely green (the 31 "mixed" ones carry a 1.2% minority, which is
labeler slips rather than a laser changing colour mid-dive).

So colour is a per-dive constant that nothing was tracking, and the dot itself
is the evidence. Measured over 332 human-labelled dots that still have a
processed JPEG in Garage: comparing R and G *at the dot* separates red from
green at 98.19%, and every one of the 6 misses is a frame where the labelled
point sits a pixel or two off the dot.

Two things that look like improvements and are not:

* Taking max(R-G) over a +-7px window scores 94.88% -- worse. A window that
  size is mostly background, and an underwater scene is blue-green, so the max
  finds the scene rather than the dot. Hence the brightest-pixels rule below:
  the dot is the bright thing in its own neighbourhood.
* Trusting any single frame. Populate takes the dive-level majority instead,
  which is what turns a 98% per-frame rule into 4/4 dives correct.

The coordinate detail is the one that would fail silently: the detector returns
*rectified* pixels, while `LinearRawImage` is in **sensor** coordinates. Sample
one at the other's coordinates and you read the wrong pixels -- near the laser
region that is tens of pixels, easily missing the dot entirely, and the result
still looks like a plausible colour.
