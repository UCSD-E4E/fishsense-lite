"""The gate that asks whether a calibration describes the dive it will measure.

`check_fit_self_consistency` compares the fitted ray's projection against the
dots it was computed from, so it is satisfied by construction and says nothing
when those dots are few. On prod dive 347 it said nothing at all: the fit came
from ONE frame carrying a duplicate laser label at the identical pixel, so the
dot set had N=1 and the check abstained, while `MIN_LASER_POINTS = 2` was
satisfied by counting the duplicate as a second observation. The calibration
that resulted is 9.4 px away from the dive's own 321 laser dots.

This gate asks the other question: project the fitted ray and compare it
against **every live dot in the dive**, including the measurement frames the
calibration was never fitted to. That is not tautological — it is the check
that the laser was in the same state for the frames being measured as it was
for the frames it was calibrated from, which is precisely what a mid-dive
re-seat breaks (prod dive 490, where the board burst and the fish frames
disagreed by 0.82 deg).

Measured over all 32 stored calibrations against their dives' live dots
(2026-09-13), median perpendicular offset in px:

    0.43 - 0.88   twenty dives
    1.31 - 1.55   six dives
    2.01, 2.27    dives 279, 509
    3.33, 3.92    dives 341, 349   <- real burst-vs-frames disagreement
    5.37          dive 498         <- also caught by the baseline gate
    9.42          dive 347         <- the degenerate fit, caught by nothing else

The bounds sit between those populations, not against the healthy one — the
same rule the baseline gate uses, and for the same reason: a refusal wedges
the dive in its cohort, so a false positive is expensive.

**It is blind to the baseline, deliberately and unavoidably.** Sliding the
laser's offset along the family of rays that share an image line leaves the
projection identical, so five of the six known-bad baselines sit at 0.43-1.35
px here and pass. That is what `check_baseline_plausible` is for; the two
gates are complementary and neither subsumes the other.
