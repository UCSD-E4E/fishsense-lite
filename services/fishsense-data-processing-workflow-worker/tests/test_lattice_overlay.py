"""Pure-logic tests for the checkerboard lattice verification overlay.

This overlay exists to answer one question a human can settle in a second and
no residual can settle at all: **are the detected corners one board square
apart, or two?**

`grid_residual_px` cannot tell, and that is not a gap in the threshold — it is
structural. A uniformly mis-latticed grid (every corner two squares apart,
`body_points` labelling them one apart) is still a perfect grid, so it is an
exact homography of the modelled grid and the residual is ~0. The guard in
`checkerboard_detection` catches a grid whose spacing is *mixed*, which breaks
regularity; the uniform case sails through it, through `_fits_declared_board`
(a coarse lattice is smaller than the declared board, so it passes an upper
bound), and through `check_fit_self_consistency` (which compares 2-D dots that
a pure scale error does not move). It then scales every depth, the fitted
baseline, and every length downstream.

Measured 2026-09-11: five of fourteen checkerboard calibrations carry a
baseline that is a simple multiple of the consensus 10.4 cm -- 4.00x, 2.16x,
2.12x, 1.51x and 0.47x -- which is the signature of exactly this. This overlay
puts the lattice in front of a labeler so that inference can be confirmed or
killed.

**The connecting lines are the point, not decoration.** Isolated corner dots
turn "is this every corner or every other one?" into a counting exercise at
high zoom. Lines make a wrong lattice self-evident: its cells visibly span two
board squares.
