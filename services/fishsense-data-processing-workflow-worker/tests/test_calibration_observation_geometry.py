"""`MIN_LASER_POINTS` counts observations; it does not ask where they are.

Stage 13 fits the laser ray from 3-D points, each the camera ray through a
labelled dot intersected with the target plane. What determines the fitted
*direction* is the lever arm — the spread of those points along the ray —
against the label noise. One pixel of dot-label noise at range z is z/f metres
of lateral error, so it rotates the fitted ray by about (z/f)/lever radians,
and the measured sensitivity of length to that angle is ~30 % per degree at
2 m. The observation count says nothing about this: sixteen dots at one range
determine the direction no better than two.

Measured over the 32 stored calibrations whose observations are recoverable
(2026-09-13), lever arm = depth spread of the extreme observations:

    dive 341   30 obs   1.55 m   ->  0.1 % of length per px of label noise
    dive 471    2 obs   1.56 m   ->  0.7 %
    dive 279    3 obs   1.47 m   ->  0.6 %
    dive 465    3 obs   1.34 m   ->  0.6 %
    dive 383    2 obs   1.09 m   ->  0.7 %
    dive 349    2 obs   0.26 m   ->  5.8 %     <- refused here
    dive 107   16 obs   0.03 m   ->  5.5 %     <- refused here
    dive 347    1 obs   0.00 m   ->  degenerate

Two observations over a metre of range are worth more than sixteen at one
distance, which is why this gate bounds the lever arm and not the count. The
bound sits between the populations (1.09 m healthy, 0.26 m bad), nearer the
bad side because a refusal wedges the dive in its cohort.

Dive 107 is the case that shows the existing gates cannot do this: sixteen
observations, a 12.95 cm baseline that `check_baseline_plausible` accepts as
the fleet's high extreme, a dot span wide enough that
`check_fit_self_consistency` does not abstain — and a 6 cm lever arm. Dive 526
had the same single-distance geometry and was only caught because its fit
happened to collapse to a 2.00 cm baseline.
