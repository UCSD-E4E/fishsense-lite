"""Unit tests for the rewritten cluster_dive_frames activity.

The activity now consumes `(image_id, taken_datetime)` pairs rather
than the data-worker's local pydantic Image type, so the workflow-
level contract crosses the worker boundary as a small shared DTO
(`fishsense_shared.ClusterDiveFramesInput`). Output shape flips from
`list[list[Image]]` to `list[list[int]]` of image_ids — the api-worker
parent persists those id lists via `images.post_cluster`.

# --- no frame may be dropped -------------------------------------------------
#
# Two defects, one root cause: HDBSCAN noise points (label -1) were discarded.
#
# 1. A dive whose frames are EVENLY SPACED has no density variation for HDBSCAN
#    to find, so every point is noise and the activity returned `[]`. Nothing
#    persisted, the stage-1 cohort's "has no PREDICTION cluster" gate stayed
#    true, and the dive was re-selected forever -- head-of-line blocking every
#    higher-id dive, because the selector is ORDER BY id LIMIT 1. Prod dive 8
#    (2 frames, 2 s apart) was selected 8 times in a row on 2026-09-16.
#    Measured: uniform spacing returns all-noise for n = 2..6.
#
# 2. Even on a dive that clusters well, noise frames vanished. Prod dive 5 has
#    17 canonical frames and 16 in clusters, so one frame had no PREDICTION
#    cluster, never entered stage 2, and was invisible to species labelling.
#
# The fix is to treat a noise point as its own singleton cluster. A PREDICTION
# cluster is a *prediction* that labelers correct in stage 6.1, and "this frame
# groups with nothing" is the honest neutral answer -- unlike lumping every
# unclustered frame together, which would assert a grouping the data does not
# support and would be actively wrong on a reef dive holding many fish.
