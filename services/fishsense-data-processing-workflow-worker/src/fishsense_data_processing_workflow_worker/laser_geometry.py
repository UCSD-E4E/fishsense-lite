"""Laser projection: where the dot is, and how long the fish is at that depth.

Two stages need the same projection. Stage 14 turns a laser dot into a depth
and measures head-to-tail across a plane at that depth;
`compute_laser_depths_activity` records the depth itself, for every frame with
a validated laser rather than only the measurable ones. Before this module the
sequence lived inline in `measure_fish_activity._measure_length`, and a second
transcription of it is precisely the kind of copy that drifts — the sign
convention alone cost a synthetic-geometry investigation
(`test_stage14_pipeline_sign_consistency.py`,
`test_compute_world_point_from_depth_convention.py`).

The kernel is `fishsense_core.world_point.WorldPointHandler`, which is why
both callers live on the data-worker: no other service depends on
fishsense-core, and vendoring the projection into one that doesn't would
recreate the drift this module exists to prevent.

The triangulation has no failure mode, and that is the thing to understand
about it. It returns the least-squares closest point between the camera ray
and the laser ray, which always exists — so for a pixel that no real laser dot
could have produced it answers just as confidently, with a point at or behind
the camera. A laser ray parallel to the image plane through the camera centre
gives the origin; a dot on the wrong side of the principal point for the
laser's offset gives a negative Z. Both are the *correct* answer to the
question that was asked; neither corresponds to an observation, and a length
computed at a negative depth is numerically identical to one at its positive
twin (the back-projection is linear in depth, so head and tail move together).
Callers must gate on `depth_m > 0`.

As of fishsense-core 3.0.0 the solve also returns its closest-approach
`residual` — how well the dot and the calibration actually agree. Recorded per
image, but not a substitute for the depth gate: see `LaserPoint` for what it
cannot see. `test_laser_geometry.py` pins all of this.

    `depth_m` is the Z component and `range_m` the Euclidean norm. They differ
    by the dot's off-axis angle and are equal only on the optical axis, so
    they are carried separately rather than left for a caller to conflate:
    stage 14's back-projection needs the depth specifically (it measures
    across a fronto-parallel plane), while "how far away was it" means the
    range.

    `residual_m` is how close the camera ray and the laser ray actually came
    to meeting — ~0 when the dot is genuinely consistent with the calibration,
    which makes it a direct per-dot check of a laser label against its
    extrinsics. Necessary, not sufficient, and the ways it falls short are
    specific: it is blind to error *along* the laser's epipolar line (a dot
    slid along it moves the depth a long way with the residual pinned at the
    noise floor), two rays meeting at the camera centre report 0 at zero or
    negative depth, it is metric so one threshold is stricter close up than
    far away, and the float32 solve puts its noise floor near 1e-5 m at metre
    scale. Pair it with the depth gate; never replace the depth gate with it.

    The axis magnitude does not matter — fishsense-core normalises it — and a
    zero-length axis raises `ValueError` rather than coming back as a
    plausible-looking point. Both landed in core 3.0.0, which we asked for
    after finding that a non-unit axis silently corrupted every derived
    distance (doubling a unit axis flipped the depth negative) and that a zero
    axis was answered with an ordinary ~1 cm depth. The raise is deliberately
    not caught: the axis belongs to the dive's calibration, so a directionless
    one makes every image in that dive unprocessable, and failing the activity
    is the honest blast radius — the same treatment a missing `LaserExtrinsics`
