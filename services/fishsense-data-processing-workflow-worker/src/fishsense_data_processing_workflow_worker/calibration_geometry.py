"""Where a laser dot sits in space, given a planar target of known geometry.

Stage 13 fits laser extrinsics from observations of the dot lying on a target
whose geometry is known. The target's *only* contribution is a **plane**: once
you have a normal and a point on it, the dot's 3-D position is the intersection
of its back-projected ray with that plane, and nothing about how the plane was
obtained survives into the answer.

That is worth stating as code rather than leaving inline, because a second
producer is coming. A large part of the pool-test corpus was shot against a
checkerboard rather than a dive slate
(`docs/plans/checkerboard-laser-calibration.md`), and a checkerboard differs
only in how `(body_points, image_points)` are obtained — detected corners at a
known square pitch instead of hand-clicked template points at a known DPI.
Everything from here down is shared:

    plane_from_correspondences  ->  laser_point_on_plane
                                ->  fishsense_core.laser.calibrate_laser
                                ->  check_fit_self_consistency
                                ->  LaserExtrinsics

The alternative — transcribing the ray-plane intersection a second time for the
checkerboard path — is precisely the drift `laser_geometry` was extracted to
prevent, and `duplicate-code` would not catch it: swapping `DiveSlateLabel` for
a checkerboard DTO is a systematic rename, which is textually invisible.

**`solvePnP` is given zero distortion on purpose.** The pipeline only ever feeds
it rectified imagery (`RectifiedImage` applies `cv2.undistort`), so the
correspondences are already in an undistorted frame. Any future caller must
detect its target on the *rectified* image for the same reason; passing raw
pixels here yields a plausible, slightly wrong pose and no error.

`test_calibration_geometry.py` pins the seam, including the property the
checkerboard plan rests on: a slate's six hand-clicked points and a
checkerboard's grid of detected corners, describing the same physical plane,
recover the same dot.
