"""Draw a detected checkerboard lattice onto its frame, for human verification.

`checkerboard_detection` decides *that* a grid is present; this module shows a
person **which** grid, so they can answer the one question no automated check
here can: are the detected corners one board square apart, or two?

**Why that question cannot be answered in code.** A uniformly mis-latticed
detection — every corner two squares apart while `body_points` labels them one
apart — is still a perfect grid. It is therefore an exact homography of the
modelled grid, so `grid_residual_px` reads ~0 and passes it. The residual gate
catches grids whose spacing is *mixed*, which breaks regularity; the uniform
case also clears `_fits_declared_board` (a coarse lattice is *smaller* than the
declared board, so an upper bound never fires) and `check_fit_self_consistency`
(which compares 2-D dots, and a pure scale error does not move them). The pose
then places the board at a fraction of its true distance and every depth, the
fitted baseline, and every length downstream scales with it.

That is not hypothetical. Measured 2026-09-11 against the known-length targets:
five of fourteen checkerboard calibrations carry a baseline that is a simple
multiple of the consensus 10.4 cm — 4.00x, 2.16x, 2.12x, 1.51x and 0.47x — and
their dives read -75% to +45% on length. A scale error of exactly 2x or 4x is
what a coarse lattice produces and what noise does not.

**The connecting lines are the instrument, not decoration.** Corner dots alone
turn "every corner, or every other one?" into a counting exercise at high zoom.
Lines make it self-evident: a wrong lattice draws cells that visibly span two
board squares.

Kept out of `checkerboard_detection` deliberately. That module is on the
calibration path and must stay free of drawing concerns; this one is only ever
called by the verification stage.
