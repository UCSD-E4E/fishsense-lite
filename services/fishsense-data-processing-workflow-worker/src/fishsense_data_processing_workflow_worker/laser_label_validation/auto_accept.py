"""Decide which laser predictions may skip human review.

The detector agrees with the labeler exactly 93% of the time (measured over
504 seeded prod predictions, laser-detector-v2): the submitted coordinate is
byte-identical to the prediction. Those reviews cost ~6.4 s each and return no
information. This module decides which of them can be skipped.

The whole design rests on one asymmetry. A laser dot's position is not
independently checkable per frame — that is what killed the slate detector,
whose per-frame ECC gate passed confident false fits — but across a dive it
is, because the dots are collinear: the projection of a laser ray that is
fixed for the whole dive. A diver is swimming, so no feature in the *scene*
persists across a dive; the rig is the only thing that does. So a false
detection has to be wrong in a way that agrees with dozens of other false
detections to get through, and scattered failure cannot manufacture that.

Consequences that shape the code:

* **The dive gate comes first, and it fails closed.** A detector doing badly
  produces predictions that do not agree, no line clears the participation
  bar, and every frame routes to a human. Poor out-of-distribution
  performance shows up as the automation declining to engage rather than as
  bad labels.
* **Two per-frame axes, not one.** Perpendicular distance is blind to a dot
  slid ALONG the laser's epipolar line, which is the direction that moves
  depth most (the same blindness `LaserDepth.residual_m` has). Prod dive 491
  image 132158 sat 1.5 px off the line and 190 px along it, at confidence
  0.9897 — a perpendicular-only gate auto-accepts it.
* **Detector confidence is not used.** It does not separate: 15 of the 22
  moved predictions scored >= 0.99 and 13 scored exactly 1.0000. It is a
  good "is there a dot" signal and a useless "is it the right dot" signal.
  It stays out of the gate deliberately.

Thresholds are measured, not chosen; see `AutoAcceptConfig`.

    because each covers the other's blind spot: a floor alone passes a
    1698-frame dive on 40 agreeing points, and a percentage alone passes 5 of
    5. Both must hold.

    `min_inlier_fraction = 0.75` sits in a measured gap. Fitting on
    predictions rather than labels, the eight v2 dives scored 0.842-1.000 and
    the three v1 dives — the only "detector doing badly" evidence in the
    corpus — scored 0.369, 0.413 and 0.679. Do NOT recalibrate this against
    `divelaserline`: those fits run on human labels *after* the validator
    superseded the outliers, so their inlier fraction is ~1.0 by construction
    (p10 = 0.985) and a bar set there is inert.

    `min_predictions = 20` keeps 164 of 226 dives and 95.5% of frames.
    `line_fit.MIN_POINTS_FOR_LINE` is 5, which is fine for the validator —
    whose worst case is discarding a good label — but far too low here, where
    the worst case is keeping a bad one silently. At n=5, three bad points are
    a majority and RANSAC only needs two to hypothesise.

    1 px off the dive line and moved ones 68 px. A 10 px band caught 19 of 22
