"""Two-line (specular reflection) detection for laser-dot populations.

Prod dive 77 (2026-08-04): pool slate photos show two bright dots — the laser
and its specular reflection ~45 px away. Labelers clicked the reflection on 34
of 79 frames, so the dive's dots formed two coherent PARALLEL lines. That
population defeats the single-line RANSAC validator in exactly the wrong way:
the split kills its confidence / trips MAX_OUTLIER_FRACTION, so it silently
skips the dive forever — while stage 13 happily consumes the poisoned mix and
persists a calibration that is 14 deg off both lines.

This module names the failure mode: after the primary fit, look for a second
coherent line among the off-line points. Near-parallel + well-separated =
reflection signature. Detection only — choosing WHICH line is the real laser
needs cross-dive consensus (sibling dives on the same camera), which is
operator-level context the per-dive validator doesn't have. The activity logs
the finding loudly for manual remediation (see the dive-77 recipe in project
memory: supersede the artifact line's labels, delete the extrinsics, refit).

Not vendored from the laser-detector repo (unlike ``line_fit``) — this is
pipeline-side diagnostics.
