"""Which colour laser made this dot, read off the dot's own pixels.

The laser LS config offers "Red Laser" and "Green Laser" and the pre-annotation
hardcoded "Red Laser", which is wrong for about a quarter of prod: 143 dives
are entirely red, 88 entirely green. Colour is a property of the rig for a
given dive, and nothing was tracking it — `resolve_laser_predict_inputs` still
sends `wavelength=None`, so the detector runs on its unknown-wavelength
channel and the pipeline had no colour to report.

The measurement, over 332 human-labelled dots that still have a processed JPEG
in Garage: comparing R against G **at the dot** separates red from green at
98.19%. All 6 misses are frames where the labelled point sits a pixel or two
off the dot, which is why this samples a small neighbourhood and weights it
toward the bright pixels rather than reading one pixel.

Taking `max(R-G)` over a ±7 px window instead scores 94.88% — *worse* than the
single centre pixel. A window that size is mostly background, and an
underwater scene is blue-green, so the max finds the scene, not the laser.
The dot is the bright thing in its own neighbourhood; that is the signal.

Per frame this is advisory. Populate takes the dive-level majority, which is
what turns a 98% per-frame rule into 4/4 dives correct on the corpus — and it
matches the physics, since one rig shoots one colour for a whole dive.
