"""Drop observations that disagree with the laser ray before fitting it.

`fishsense_core.laser.calibrate_laser` is plain least squares with no outlier
rejection, so one badly-placed observation drags the whole line. Prod dive 77
is the worked example: labelers clicked the laser's specular reflection on
about half its frames and the persisted calibration produced +137% length
errors. Dive 103 is the quieter version — a 6.25 cm baseline from 17 otherwise
clean observations, which neither a higher `MIN_LASER_POINTS` nor the baseline
bound explains.

**The geometry amplifies it.** The fit reports where the ray crosses z=0,
typically a metre or more behind the observations, so a small angular error
from one bad point is levered into a large error in the *baseline* — the one
quantity `check_fit_self_consistency` provably cannot see, because sliding the
offset leaves the ray's projection unchanged.

Trimming is deliberately conservative. It is a guard against a few bad
observations, not a way to rescue a badly contaminated dive: past
`MAX_TRIM_FRACTION` it declines to trim at all and lets the baseline gate
refuse the result, because when most observations disagree there is no majority
worth trusting and quietly fitting the larger half would produce a confident
answer from data we have no reason to believe.

Pure numpy, no Temporal and no `fishsense_core`, so it is unit-testable
anywhere and can be reasoned about on synthetic geometry with a known answer.
