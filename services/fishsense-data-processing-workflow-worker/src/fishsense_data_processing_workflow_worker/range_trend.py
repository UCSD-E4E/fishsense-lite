"""Scale-free range-trend audit of a dive's laser calibration.

WHAT IT SEES THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES. The image of the laser line fixes only
the plane through the camera centre that contains it. Where the laser sits
*within* that plane -- the in-plane angle that sets metric scale -- moves the
dots by ~1e-13 px, so every check that looks at the dots is blind to it:
reprojection residual (measured rho = -0.03 against length error), the
7.8-14.5 cm baseline plausibility gate (three baseline outliers all measure
within 1.6 %), and the dot-on-board depth check (the calibration was fitted
from those frames). An in-plane error eps does, however, leave a signature in
the *measurements*: depth goes as b*f/d, a rotation shifts the vanishing point
by f*eps, and to first order

    z_measured = z * (1 + eps * z / b)

so a rigid object reads a length that changes linearly with range, at
eps / b per metre. A 0.15 deg error on a 10.3 cm baseline is -2.5 % per metre.

WHY IT IS SCALE-FREE. "The same object must read the same length at every
range" spends no reference length. The slope is fitted on the object's own
measurements; a known length is never consulted, so the test cannot be
circular in the way anchoring a calibration to a fish model is. That is the
HANDOFF's ruler-at-two-ranges argument, applied to every rigid object a dive
carries.

WHAT IT MEASURED ON THE CORPUS (2026-09-12, 2,927 measurements, 32 dives; see
imwut_2026_fishsense_lite/post_labeling_analysis/HANDOFF.md). Fitted on frames
at >= 0.8 m with >= 8 frames spanning a >= 2x range:

  * Negative slopes: every cell whose interval sat below -2 %/m was a
    calibration already known bad from the known lengths -- dive 490 at
    -13.3 %/m (recovered angle -0.78 deg against 0.82 deg measured directly
    between its two calibration bursts), its borrowers 491 / 492 at
    -3.8 / -2.8 (-0.22 / -0.17 deg against 0.21 / 0.25 from the known
    lengths), 494 at -6.1 and 509 at -4.1. The two August repairs, 60 and 76,
    read -2.3 on each target (-0.14 deg against the 0.146 deg the repair
    fitted) with intervals reaching -1.1, so they are seen but not flagged.
  * Positive slopes are calibration signal too, and were at first misread.
    They track SHORT fitted baselines: 503 / 504 (borrowing dive 502 at
    8.90 cm) read +5.3 / +5.5 %/m, 498 (9.51 cm) +2.8, 501 (10.12) +1.6,
    while every 10.3-10.5 cm calibration sits within -1.0..+0.9. The per-bin
    structure says what it is: -14 to -18 % at 0.8 m rising to ~0 at 4 m, a
    short baseline's flat scale error paired with a compensating angle error
    that cancel exactly where the median and p90 sit -- which is how those
    dives graded "-1 %" against the known lengths and passed both the cohort
    rule and the old 7.8 cm baseline floor. So both signs flag. What remains
    ambiguous on the positive side is object-specific: the single-object
    angle sessions (87 / 114 are positive even broadside-only) and the Shark
    on dive 76 (+5.3 while the Purple Angel on the same dive reads -2.2, which
    one angle cannot do). A flag on a normal multi-frame rigid target is a
    calibration finding; a flag on those two kinds is not, and the note says
    which reading applies to the sign.
  * A milder close-range under-read remains on the Weasly Fish alone (near
    -6/-7 % against far -2/-4 % on sound dives; the Box shows none). It is
    concentrated below 0.8 m, which is why those frames are dropped before
    the fit rather than after.
  * It is blind to a range-flat scale error on its own. Dives 506 and 507
    both borrow dive 505 and over-read (+4.3 / +2.2 pp) with slopes of +0.8
    and +0.1 %/m. A baseline error that the fit did NOT pair with an angle
    error stays invisible here; the baseline plausibility gate is the check
    for that.

WHERE IT CAN RUN. It needs one rigid object measured many times across a wide
range spread. Every rigid-target pool dive has that (33 usable cells over 25
dives). No wild-fish dive does: the five fish in prod with >= 5 measurements
span at most a 1.5x range. So this is a post-hoc audit for the validation
corpus, not a stage-13 gate (stage 13 has only the board frames the fit came
from) and not, today, a field check -- it would become one if the protocol
had the diver photograph a rigid reference at two ranges after calibrating.
