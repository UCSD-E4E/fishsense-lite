abstract: >-
  Length is a vital metric for studying a fish population's
  overall health. Studying size distribution over time can
  aid in documenting population recovery efforts. Common
  scientific methods include having divers manually survey
  an area and record individuals and their approximate sizes
  (known as a roving diver survey), which has the potential
  to be inaccurate and catch and release, which is
  time-consuming and highly invasive. Previous attempts at
  automating this process use a dual laser caliper system,
  which is difficult to calibrate and maintain, and stereo
  cameras, which are costly and require extensive manual
  work. We propose a system that is relatively
  cost-effective and easy to use, with the ultimate goal of
  it being able to be built and used by citizen scientists.
  This system consists of a standard underwater
  point-and-shoot camera combined with a single laser using
  a 3D-printed mount, for which we provide a tool for
  calibration and length calculation. By using this system
  to measure objects of known length, we are able to verify
  a measurement error of less than $20\%$ at ranges of up to
  5 meters.
